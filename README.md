## Promodoro Timer
This is a simple Pomodoro Timer, a great tool for students when studying! The default settings are a 15 minute study period and 5 minute break. The user can input their own times as they wish. 
This project has taught me about creating timers using Javascript, how to format user inputs for time, and how to use CSS to code a pop-up window.
